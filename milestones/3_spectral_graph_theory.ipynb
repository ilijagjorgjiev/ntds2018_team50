Thus we would have originaly used the function mentioned in the above comments scipy.linalg.eigh(laplacian.toarray()), as it would have returned us the eigenvalues in asceding order and all of them, also our matrix is real symmetric(hermitian). Otherwise we decided to go with eigsh as it allows us to specify how many eigenvalues and eigenvectors we want and in what order(in our case we would need to use which=\"SM\", but as we said the matrix is too big and running make take hours of running even for 200, that is why we decided to go with computing just 200 eigenvalues and eigenvectors any of them actually), as this would make our cell actually execute, even though still it takes some time. The eigsh can be executed also since our matrix is hermitian and sparse."

    "Matrix $S$ is the incidence matrix. It has a shape of ($|E|$, $|V|$) , where $|E|$ is the number of edges starting from edge 1 to N and $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph. The incidence matrix consits of values of $0$, $1$, $-1$. In the incidence matrix each entry shows the direction of the edge written in the following way:\n",

When multiplying $S$ with $S^\\top$, what actually happens is each such $E_{row}$ let's call it $E_k$ will contain $1$ and $-1$, all other entries would be $0s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we basically have product of 2 vectors of size 2, since the $0s$ do make any change in the product, even though they are actually there as making the order of positions fine. In this case, what we are going to get a matrix of size $4x4$(not considering the $0s$) in which the diagonals entries count the incident edges(degree of each vertex $i$ in the end) and the off-diagonals will be always multiply a $1$ with $-1$(basically the adjacency matrix), which says that the edge is adjacent and thus we effectively lose the direction. Thus, we can conclude that the laplacian does not depend on the edge direction. "
