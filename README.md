This repository contains the material for the practical work associated with the EPFL
master course [EE-558 A Network Tour of Data Science][epfl] ([moodle]), taught
in fall 2018. The content is similar to the [2017 edition]. Compared to the
[2016 edition], the course has been refocused on graph and network sciences.
The course material revolves around the following topics:

1. [Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science),
1. [Spectral Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory),
1. [Graph Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0053),
1. [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science),
1. [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

Theoretical knowledge is taught during lectures.
Practical knowledge is taught through [tutorials](#tutorials).
Both are practiced and evaluated through a [semester project](#projects).
More information about the course is found in [those slides][practical_info].

## Projects

During the course of a semester project, students exercise the theory seen in class on real data and networks.
Projects are carried out by groups of four students, and are to be chosen in the list of [proposed projects](projects).
The students have to deliver four milestones, following the theory seen in class:

1. [Network properties][m1]: measure and interpret some properties of the network.
1. Network models: fit some relevant network models and comment on their fitness.
1. Spectral graph theory: visualize or cluster your graph using the spectrum of the graph Laplacian.
1. Graph signal processing: analyze data (signals, features) on the graph.

After completing those milestones, they are free to pursue any other direction of interest.
Those data projects are meant to jointly evaluate their theoretical network analysis skills and practical Data Science skills.

Below is their work.

## Installation

Click the [binder badge][binder_lab] to play with the notebooks from your
browser without installing anything.

For a local installation, you will need [git], [Python], and packages from the [Python scientific stack][scipy].
If you don't know how to install those on your platform, we recommend to install [Miniconda] or [Anaconda], a distribution of the [conda] package and environment manager.
Follow the below instructions to install it and create an environment for the course.

1. Download the Python 3.x installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux from
   <https://conda.io/miniconda.html> and install with default settings. Skip
   this step if you have conda already installed (from [Miniconda] or
   [Anaconda]). Linux users may prefer to use their package manager.
   * Windows: Double-click on `Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe`.
   * macOS: Run `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` in your terminal.
   * Linux: Run `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` in your terminal.
1. Open a terminal. Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
1. Install git with `conda install git`.
1. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the course material with `cd path/to/ntds`.
   Windows users may need `\` instead of `/` as the path separator.
1. Download this repository with `git clone https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018`.
1. Enter the repository with `cd ntds_2018`.
1. Create an environment with the packages required for the course with
   `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
1. If everything went fine, you should be able to run the [`test_install.ipynb`][test_install] notebook after following the below steps.

[test_install]: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mdeff/ntds_2018/blob/outputs/test_install.ipynb

Every time you want to work, do the following:

1. Open a terminal. Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
1. Activate the environment with `conda activate ntds_2018`
   (or `activate ntds_2018`, or `source activate ntds_2018`).
1. Navigate to the folder where you stored the course material with `cd path/to/ntds_2018`.
1. Start Jupyter with `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`. The command should
   open a new tab in your web browser.
1. Edit and run the notebooks from your browser.
