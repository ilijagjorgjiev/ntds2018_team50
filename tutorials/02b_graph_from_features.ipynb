It should take its maximum value when the distance is zero, and tend to zero when the distance increases. Note that distances are non-negative by definition. So any funtion $f : \\mathbb{R}^+ \\rightarrow [0,C]$ that verifies $f(0)=C$ and $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow +\\infty}f(x)=0$ and is *strictly* decreasing should be adapted. The choice of the function depends on the data.\n",
